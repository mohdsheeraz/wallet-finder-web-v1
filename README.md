# wallet-finder-web-v1
Web based wallet finder source code different from server based and app based code
Can be used by uploading oon any hosting and accessing the file url limited resourced (api limit could be hit)
The v2 is different from this making the code run on a server
The App (Flutter) based code is also different because of unique and new algo and code language

This is a good project to start with.
It has all the features and funtions that a beginner needs like generating a random wallet and checking if it has any balance if yes then log the balance on server database.
